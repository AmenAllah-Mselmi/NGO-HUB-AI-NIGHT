Unified Organization System
Overview
We are moving to an Abstract Entity Organization model. There is no longer a strict database distinction between a "Club" and an "NGO". Both are just "Organizations" (orgs). We will drop all existing club, ngo, and related tables, and rebuild the system from scratch with a clean, unified schema. To accelerate development, all Row Level Security (RLS) policies will be fully public (read and write access for anyone). We can lock down RLS later once the frontend is fully wired up.

Database Schema (The "Rebuild")
We will create a massive SQL script to:

DROP TABLE for all existing club and ngo tables (with CASCADE).
Create the new org ecosystem.
New Tables
orgs: The core entity (id, name, type (enum: 'club' | 'ngo'), mission, description, parent_id, etc.)
org_unit_types: User-defined structural names (Chapter, Team, Department)
org_units: Instances of those types
org_roles: Roles (President, Member, etc.) with permissions arrays
org_members: Links users to orgs, roles, and units. Includes engagement points.
org_events, org_posts, org_comments: Unified events and community feeds.
Public RLS
Every table will have:

sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Public full access" ON table_name FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
Migration Steps
SQL Cleanup & Rebuild: Execute the drop-and-rebuild script in Supabase.
Types: Create src/types/organization.ts unifying all types.
Services: Rewrite 
clubs.service.ts
 and 
ngo.service.ts
 into a unified organization.service.ts.
Pages:
Unified OrgCreatePage (replaces 
CreateClubPage
 and 
NGOCreatePage
).
Unified OrgDetailsPage (replaces 
ClubDetailsPage
 and 
NGODetailsPage
).
Components: Refactor components to use the new org terminology.
User Review Required
WARNING

This will DELETE ALL EXISTING CLUBS AND NGOS in the database to ensure a clean slate. Since RLS will be public, anyone can edit anything (for now). Please confirm if you are ready for me to write and execute the DROP and CREATE SQL script.
